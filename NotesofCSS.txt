Notes of CSS

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, 
layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.


Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

CSS is composed of style rules that the browser interprets and then applies to the corresponding elements in your document.
