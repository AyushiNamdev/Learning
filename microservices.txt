Monolithic and Microservices

client is connected to gateaway 
and gateaway is connected to microservices

team is small - go for monolithicis
team is big- go for microservices

monolith does not need to be single, we can have more
we can scale it more

microservices:
single business unit, talk to dedicated databases

Advantages of Monolithic:
stack overflow
scales out- multiple server
good for small team 
lesser moving part
setting up is easy
less duplicacy 
procedure call is faster

Disadvantages:

more context required to learn for a new person
deployment are tough
too much responsibilty on each server
one crashes, everything crashes
-----------------

Microservices:
google, facebook
easier for new
parallel development is easy
profiles, analytics, chat
lesser parts are hidden
we can clearly see which needs more server

Disadvantages:
not easy to design
if service one is only talking to service 2 all the  time, then it can be a one service
smart architecture needed
