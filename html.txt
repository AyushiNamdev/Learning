How a code is written?

An opening tag (<p>)
The content (“Hello World!” text)
A closing tag (</p>)
HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket.

Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.

Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.


Here’s what opening and closing body tags look like:

<body>
 
</body>
Once the file has a body, 
many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body.
